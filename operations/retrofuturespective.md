# Yearly retrofuturespective

✨

At the end of the year, before our break, we conduct a workshop to examine how we arrived where we are now, and to develop goals and plans for what we want to work on in the next year. We use a lot of sticky notes to do the following exercises. It usually takes at least two hours.

- **One-word intro.** A warm-up. Using one word, describe how you feel about the last year. Talk about it, if you want.
- **Liked, learned, lacked.** Write up tasks, activities, feelings — whatever — from the last year for each of the categories. What did you like about last year? What did you learn? What did you lack? Consider last year’s hopes and concerns in this exercise. It’s also an opportunity to celebrate achievements, recognize each others’ contributions, and consider what’s lacking.
- **Hopes & concerns.** What are your hopes and concerns for the coming year? Organize and group similar sticky notes, and name them.
- **Who, what, when.** Create specific, measurable, time-bound goals and actions toward addressing the hopes and concerns we’ve outlined. Who will do what, and when, to help us meet our goals? How will we hold ourselves accountable? What are the ideal outcomes?
- **One-word outro.** Using one word, describe how you feel about next year, after conducting the workshop. Talk about it, if you want.

The retros informs the kind of client work we want accept in the coming year, guides the self-initiated projects we undertake during Rumors Fridays investment time, and helps shape studio-wide and individual performance goals.
