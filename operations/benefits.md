# Benefits

These are our standard benefits; your employment contract might be slightly different.

## Salary

We’ll direct deposit your pay on the last Friday of every month. Talk to Andy to set that up — until then, we’ll cut you a check. Payroll is managed by Paychex. You can [create an account](https://myapps.paychex.com/) to download pay stubs.

## Time off

We’re closed on these holidays:

- New Year’s Day
- Martin Luther King, Jr. Day
- Presidents’ Day
- Memorial Day
- Independence Day
- Labor Day
- Veterans Day
- Thanksgiving Day and Thanksgiving Friday
- Christmas Eve and Christmas Day

We close for the **week between Christmas and New Year’s Day** and the **week of July 4**. We’ll determine the exact closure dates the preceding quarter. 

We expect you to take time to vote and participate in jury duty. 

- **Vacation.** Take at least 10 paid vacation days in a year, and up to 15, in addition to our regular closures and breaks. Vacation days don’t roll over. Request vacation from Andy at least two weeks in advance, and put it in the calendar.
- **Sick days.** 10 paid sick days per year. You can use these for physical illness, mental health, personal reasons, whatever. You don’t need a doctor’s note. Unused sick leave will not roll over year-to-year. Let us know as soon as you can if you’ll be out.
- **Family leave.** We offer 30 days of paid parental leave. In addition, you may elect to receive 12 unpaid workweeks of leave, as stipulated by [FMLA](https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/) (Family Medical Leave Act). You can use this time for the birth of a child; an adoption or foster care placement; to care for a partner, child, or parent; or for a serious health condition that limits your ability to work. If something else is going on, talk to Andy.

## Health stipend

We’ll give you $280 per month to use toward health insurance premium payments. You choose your own coverage. 

## Retirement plan
After six months of full-time employment, you’re eligible to enroll in the retirement plan. It’s a SIMPLE IRA, and we’ll match up to 3%.

## Professional development

We’ll cover up to $3000 of professional development expenses per year, which you can use for things like books, courses, classes, and conferences, plus related travel expenses. Submit your receipts to Andy for reimbursement.
