# Hiring and onboarding

## Hiring

We don’t hire often, and we strongly favor a good cultural fit over a particular list of skills or qualifications. When someone new comes in for an interview, we have a casual conversation using this as a guide for what to talk about and how.

### Best practices

- Introduce the studio in general, everyone’s role, and the kinds of projects we take on
- Discuss skills desired and expectations for the open position
- Make it like a conversation; leave some space and let pauses linger
- Share our code of conduct

### Development

- Tell us about a project you’ve built with end-to-end logic
- You’ll be jumping into in-progress projects, and things we’ve completed — what’s your approach to diving into systems you didn’t create?
- How do you explain technical concepts to a non-technical audience?
- How do you determine which technologies, or approaches, are appropriate for a given project?
- How have you worked with other developers?
- If you were excited about a new feature or technology, how would you bring it to the team?
- How do you present your work to your teammates?

### Problem-solving

- Can you give us an example of a time you had a really challenging project that required a lot of problem-solving? How did you tackle it? What was the outcome?
- In general, what’s your approach to solving problems? 
- How do you teach yourself something new?

### Teams

- What was your last team like?
- How did you work together?
- What were your standups like?
- What would your coworkers say about you?
- Did you introduce any systems to help make projects or approaches easier?
-  Have you ever had conflicts with clients or teammates? What happened? How did you resolve it?

### Work environment

- What’s your ideal work environment?
- How do you work best? What do you need?
- What are your goals for growth?
- What would you want from this role?
- What don’t you know very well that you want to learn?

## Onboarding
