# Performance reviews

Performance reviews are employee-centric assessments lead by Andy. They are not tied to hire date, but a regular ritual that takes place in December and June. Usually they involve lunch. 

As an employer, Andy will provide:

- Specific, constructive, actionable feedback on your role and project outcomes
- Support of your professional growth and self-directed initiatives
- An opportunity for peer recognition

As an employee, you’ll provide:

- A few flexible, self-determined goals that align with your practice (e.g., design, development, strategy) and overall studio goals

Your performance goals should be:

- Ambitious and maybe a little bit uncomfortable
- Convey endpoints and outcomes, not maintenance or continuance
- Tangible and unambiguous

New employees will have two opportunities to check in with Andy and set expectations and goals following the early days of their employment.

- An initial check-in after six weeks
- A performance review after three months
