# Handbook

**⚠️ WIP ⚠️**

The Rumors handbook is an ongoing documentation of our process and operations. It is developed collaboratively, updated frequently, and maintained mostly by [@frangrit](https://github.com/frangrit). There are two sections, written with different audiences in mind:

**For clients.**  
An overview of our approach and what to expect during client engagements.  
[Read the client welcome packet →](clients/index.md)

**For new employees.**  
Lots of detail about what we do, how we do it, and our guiding philosophies, plus practical matters like operating hours and benefits.  
[Read the employee handbook →](employees/index.md) 

Propose changes in [issues](https://github.com/rumors/handbook/issues), or open a pull request. Or just email us with questions — everyone@rumo.rs.
