# Handbook

**⚠️ WIP ⚠️**

The Rumors handbook is an ongoing documentation of our operations and process. It is developed collaboratively, updated frequently, and maintained mostly by [@frangrit](https://github.com/frangrit). Propose changes in [issues](https://github.com/rumors/handbook/issues), or open a pull request.

## Process

Rumors is a small studio with five full-time designers. We work collaboratively, so while our roles are specific, they are also fluid. We are generalists, thinkers, and writers. Our methodology is context-specific, and every client and project is different, but most of the time our process touches on these phases.

- New business development
