# Email

We use Gmail. Andy will create your account.

# Calendar

We use Google Calendar to mark events, meetings, major milestones, closures, vacations.

# Documents

We use Dropbox Paper for most project planning, documentation, notes, working files, and sometimes presentations. Most of our work takes place in *Projects*, which is organized by client name. Within each client folder is a folder for each project or product. Preface all your files with *YYYYMMDD*, so we know what’s most recent.

For things like proposals, briefs, and other client-facing deliverable documents, we use Pages and export to PDF for clients.

# Files

We use Dropbox to store files. Administrative stuff is in the *Rumors Admin* folder. Ask Andy if you need access to this folder. Client work is in the *Rumors Team* folder, organized by client name. Within each client folder is a folder for each project or product. Within that:

- **Assets.** Stuff the client gives us.
- **Deliverables.** Stuff we give the client. (Some deliverables may be in Paper.)
- **Design.** Working design files, if they’re not in Figma.

Add folders within as needed to keep things organized. Preface all your files with *YYYYMMDD*, so we know what’s most recent.

# Logins and passwords

We use 1Password to manage project passwords. Andy will set up your account.

# Meetings

We use Skype, Google Hangouts, or Slack calls for remote meetings. It depends on the client. Meetings should be under an hour and should have a purpose and an agenda, even a simple one.

# Time-tracking

Track your time on every project, whether or not it’s billable. We use Harvest; we’re planning to switch to Airtable in 2019. 

# Research, strategy & design
- Paper, post-its, pencils for sketching and thinking
- Dropbox for asset and documentation storage
- Dropbox Paper for early notes, design and strategic thinking, brief drafts, content development
- Airtable for content audits and modeling; as a CMS for early prototypes
- Figma for initial design exploration and interactive components

# Development

Use whatever code editor and browser you want.

- Webpack as a build tool
- elint and sasslint to lint our code
- A standard global config file
- Vue.js for web applications
- Middleman + Stimulus for static sites
- Ruby/Rails for custom builds
- GitHub for code versioning
- Zenhub to manage development process
- SVGOMG

## Browsers
Contractually we support “modern browsers” — any browser with substantial market share maintained by its vendor at the time of anticipated product launch, i.e. Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge.	

## Hosting
Hosting depends on the project needs, but we like to use these services.

- AWS S3/Google Cloud
- Heroku
- Netlify
