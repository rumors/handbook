#Project handoff

We’ve built the thing as mutually agreed and the client has paid us. Here’s what happens next.

Unless we have a maintenance contract, or a long-term partnership with an organization, we will hand off ownership of code and dependencies. Once we’ve finished training the new repository owner and the repository is transferred we delete our keys and all project related passwords from 1Password.

When we close a project we transfer ownership of:

- GitHub repository
- Google analytics
- AWS or other cloud services
- Hosting
- Domain registrar
- Dependencies and services

And we’ve provided:

- One or more hands-on pairing sessions to review code, dependencies, and deployment
- Code and administrative documentation
- A detailed readme in the repository
- Full admin permissions in the CMS
- Server access keys
- A list of all relevant services, dependencies, and passwords
- An automated backup system

It’s helpful if our clients have some kind of technical point person in place who can serve as the bearer of this institutional development knowledge. But the kinds of clients we work with typically do not. If that’s the case, we recommend entering into a maintenance contract — but it’s not required.

With a maintenance plan in place we’ll retain ownership of the repository. A maintenance contract is typically just a couple hours a month dedicated to specific tasks like updating content management systems, plugins, and dependencies. For most things outside of that, we’ll issue a new statement of work.
